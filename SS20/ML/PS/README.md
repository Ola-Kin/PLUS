# Machine Learning (PS)

In the PS to the *Machine Learning* lecture, we will solve exercises closely
related to the material we discuss. Many of the exercises are taken (or adapted) from the book by Shalev-Schwartz and Ben-David.

## News

- The PS starts on **Mon., March 2, 2020** (11:30am, HS Lise Meitner)
- The submission system will be open by March 13, 2020

## Grading

Grading is based on exercise sheets. Each exercise will have points associated
with it. There will be a total of 100 points to achieve. A positive grade starts
at 51 points. The completed exercises of a PS sheet need to be handed-in before the next PS, in which we will discuss the solutions.

**Note**: All exercise sheets have to be handed in online [here](https://abgaben.cosy.sbg.ac.at/).

When you want to log-in for the first time, you have to reset your password using your “Matrikelnummer” as a user name. All group members can potentially upload material for their group.
