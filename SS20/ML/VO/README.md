# Machine Learning (VO)

## News / Important dates

- The course will start on **March 2, 2020** (10am-11:30am, HS Lise Meitner)
- The first exam date is **July 9, 2020** (10am-11:30am)

## Grading

Grading is based on **one final exam** at the end of the course (typically in the last lecture).

### Information for online exam

The exam this year will be an **online**, written exam. It is an **open-book** exam, so you can use 
whatever literature/course material you desire. The procedure is detailed below:

**Each student** who wants to participate in the exam, do the following:

0. Sign-up for the exam within the **PLUS Online** system.
1. Go to [random.org](https://www.random.org/integer-sets/) and generate 5 random integers between 1 and 15.
2. Send the output (e.g., `Set 1: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12`) to me via e-mail (`Roland.Kwitt@sbg.ac.at`) with the email
subject `ML20 exam sequence`.
3. 10 min. before the exam time, I will release (on the VO website) a PDF with 15 questions. Solve the exercises
with the numbers matching your personal random sequence (from Step 2).
4. Each question should be on a **separate page** (annotated with *page number*, *Name* and *Matrikelnummer*).
4. At the end of the exam time, *scan* or *take a picture* of your student ID and all sheets that have relevant content, zip those files and send it via email to `Roland.Kwitt@sbg.ac.at` (within a 20 min. time window).

During the exam, I will be available on **Google Meet** (I will provide a link before the exam starts) for the time 
of the exam, in case there are any questions.

## Lecture material

The course is rather self-contained and most of the material will be discussed on the basis of
my slides and the book by Shalev-Schwartz and Ben-David (see below). If something is **not** on
my slides (e.g., whiteboard notes, derivations, etc.), I will provide references or online
resources. I will also try to scan-in my handwritten notes if required.

Please, **always check the most recent versions** (since updates might have occurred).
I typically update the slides after the lecture to clarify issues raised by the students.
