# Machine Learning (VO)

## News / Important dates

- The course will start on **March 2., 2020** (10am-11:30am, HS Lise Meitner)

## Grading

Grading is based on **one final exam** at the end of the course (typically in the last lecture).

## Lecture material

The course is rather self-contained and most of the material will be discussed on the basis of
my slides and the book by Shalev-Schwartz and Ben-David (see below). If something is **not** on
my slides (e.g., whiteboard notes, derivations, etc.), I will provide references or online
resources. I will also try to scan-in my handwritten notes if required.

Please, **always check the most recent versions** (since updates might have occurred).
I typically update the slides after the lecture to clarify issues raised by the students.
