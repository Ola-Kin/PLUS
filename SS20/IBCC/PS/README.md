# Imaging Beyond Consumer Cameras (PS)

## News

- The PS starts on **March 3, 2020** (10:30am-11:30am, T04)

## Grading

Grading is based on exercise sheets. The completed exercises of a PS sheet 
need to be handed-in by the deadline(s) listed below.

Each exercise has a specific value (in points) and you have to have at least half of the total sum of the points of all exercises for a positive grade (total will
be 100, hence 51 already gives a positive grade). 

**Note**: All exercise sheets have to be handed in online [here](https://abgaben.cosy.sbg.ac.at/).

When you want to log-in for the first time, you have to reset your password using your “Matrikelnummer” as a user name. All group members can potentially upload material for their group.

## Exercise sheets

will be announced once the course has started!
