# Imaging Beyond Consumer Cameras (PS)

## News

- The PS starts on **March 3, 2020** (10:30am-11:30am, T04)

Due to the current **COVID-19** situation, we will not physically meet for the PS. My plan is to provide short videos on the solutions to the PS exercises (please check this website regularly). I will also setup a Slack channel where you can ask questions (you can ask by e-mail as well).

## Slack channel

The slack channel #ibcc is on [`visel.slack.com`](https://visel.slack.com). It should be possible to sign up with your
offical University of Salzburg e-mail address ending in
`@sbg.ac.at` (`@cosy.sbg.ac.at` and `@stud.sbg.ac.at` work as well).

## Grading

Grading is based on exercise sheets. The completed exercises of a PS sheet need to be handed-in by the deadline(s) listed below.

Each exercise has a specific value (in points) and you have to have at least half of the total sum of the points of all exercises for a positive grade (total will
be 100, hence 51 already gives a positive grade).

**Note**: All exercise sheets have to be handed in online [here](https://abgaben.cosy.sbg.ac.at/).

When you want to log-in for the first time, you have to reset your password using your “Matrikelnummer” as a user name. All group members can potentially upload material for their group.
