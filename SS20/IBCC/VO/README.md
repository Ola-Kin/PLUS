# Imaging Beyond Consumer Cameras (VO)

While consumer electronics cameras are, by far, the most prevalent modality
today (with millions of images on the internet), many other imaging modalities
exist to acquire *visual* data. This ranges from a variety of techniques to
image parts of the human body (e.g., MRI, CT, X-Ray) to modalities that
capture 3D information of our environment (e.g., structured-light, time-of-flight,
etc.). In this course, we will take a closer look at the principles of some of
these imaging modalities and then discuss algorithms to process the data.
