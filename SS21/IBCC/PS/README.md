## Grading

Grading is based on exercise sheets. The completed exercises of a PS sheet need to be handed-in by the deadline(s) listed below.

You can decide which questions on an exercise sheet to solve. The solutions have to be handed-in by the **deadline** announced below. I will provide, for each student and exercise sheet, an upload link (which will be sent out via e-mail once a new exercise sheet is available).

At the time of the deadline, these links will be deactivated. Note that the links will be **upload** only. For exerises that can be solved on paper, please add your name and student number to each page, number the pages, scan them and convert the scans into **one** PDF to be uploaded (hand-written solutions are OK, as long as they are readable). In case, code has to be submitted, please create **one** ZIP file containing the code (detailed instructions will be available in the exercise sheets).
 
Once the deadline has passed, I will provide a short video explaining one possible solution to each exercise. There will be **100** achievable points total. A positive grade starts at >50.
