# Imaging Beyond Consumer Cameras (VO)

While consumer electronics cameras are, by far, the most prevalent modality
today (with millions of images on the internet), many other imaging modalities
exist to acquire *visual* data. This ranges from a variety of techniques to
image parts of the human body (e.g., MRI, CT, X-Ray) to modalities that
capture 3D information of our environment (e.g., structured-light, time-of-flight,
etc.). In this course, we will take a closer look at the principles of some of
these imaging modalities and then discuss algorithms to process the data.

## News / Important dates

- The course will be **fully virtual**
- Our Google meet link for the **Q&A** sessions is [here](https://meet.google.com/zka-jpyj-hmg)

## Scheduled Q&A sessions

- **`03/02/2021`** (10:00am - *Vorbesprechung* VO/PS combined)

## Slack channel

The slack channel `#ibcc` is on [`visel.slack.com`](https://visel.slack.com). It should be possible to sign up with your offical University of Salzburg e-mail address ending in `@sbg.ac.at` (`@cosy.sbg.ac.at` and `@stud.sbg.ac.at` work as well).

## Grading

Grading is based on **one final exam** at the end of the course. This exam will also be held online and is an open-book type exam. Exam details will be available towards the end of the summer term (and will be announced here and by e-mail).

## Lecture material

All the lecture material will be provided in the form of slides, associated lecture videos and
written notes. The release of the videos follows the typical course of the lecture. Please check
regularly for updates. Once the video is online, the content of the slides is final.
