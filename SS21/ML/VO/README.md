# Machine Learning (VO)

## News / Important dates

- The course will be held **fully online**
- Our Google meet link for Q&A sessions is [here]()

## Scheduled Q&A sessions

will be announced soon!

## General information about online teaching

The course is structured as a series of lectures. For each lecture, I will provide videos that can be downloaded and watched whenever you prefer. I do recommend that you watch them in the provided order. 

I will also provide, on a regular basis, an **online Q&A sessions** (via Google meet), where you can ask questions, or raise issues that have come up while studying the material. My plan is to do this every other week. The dates can be found above.

## Grading

Grading is based on **one final exam** at the end of the course (typically in the last lecture).

### Information for online exam

will be announced soon!

## Lecture material

The course is rather self-contained and most of the material will be developed step-by-step on the blackboard (which is my iPad now :). To every video, I will also provide a PDF with my notes.

Additionally, you can find most of the material in my supporting [slides](ml.pdf)
, and in the book by Shalev-Schwartz and Ben-David (see below) which is my main reference for the course.  

### Staying up-to-date

Please, **always check the most recent versions** (since updates might have occurred).
I typically update the slides from time to time to clarify issues raised by the students.
I do recommend that you simpy clone my teaching repository (done once) via

```bash
cd ~/
git clone
```

and then regularly do a `git pull`:

```bash
cd ~/rkwitt-teaching
cd SS20
git pull
```

### Proofs / Notes
