# Computer Vision (VO)

## News / Important dates

- We will start with the first lecture on **Oct. 7, 2020** (online)

The course will happen fully online. I will provide lecture videos


## Grading

Grading is based on a **final exam** at the end of the semester (typically the first date for the exam is the last lecture, however, we can find a date other than that which works for most students).

## Material

One of the **core resources** of the course is the [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow, Bengio and
Courville (available online) which covers most of the deep learning basics.

All most all of my course material is available through Jupyter notebooks. Those notebooks can be downloaded from the course Github repository and also contain links to other resources.

## Prerequisites

I do recommend to refresh your **linear algebra**, **statistics** and
**analysis** knowledge before starting the course. Also, please make yourself
familiar with Python, as I do use Python almost exclusively (via Jupyter notebooks).
I will provide a short introduction in the PS, though. Also, you can start
reading up on PyTorch which we will use as our environment for deep learning.

## Course topics

Below is a more detailed list of topics covered in the course, subject to change depending
on the progress we make (*links and videos available starting mid-Sep. 2020*).
