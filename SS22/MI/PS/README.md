# Medical Imaging (PS)

## News

- The PS begins on **Tue., March 1, 2022** at **10:30am**

## Organization

Given the current COVID + teaching guidelines (see [here](https://www.plus.ac.at/news/lehre-ab-maerz-2022/?pgrp=218&is_paged=0)), the lecture will be held in person. 

The PS is based on exercise sheets. The completed exercises of a PS sheet need to be handed-in by the deadline(s) listed below. You (groups of max. size 3) can decide which questions on an exercise sheet to solve. The solutions have to be handed-in by the **deadline** announced below. I will provide, for each group and exercise sheet, an upload link (which will be sent out via e-mail once a new exercise sheet is available).

*Please enter all group members [here](https://myfiles.sbg.ac.at/index.php/s/TsZa9RDpYHYX7Eg)* and make sure you do not overwrite the group membership of other students.

At the time of the deadline, these links will be deactivated. Note that the links will be **upload** only. For exercises that can be solved on paper, please add your name and student number to each page, number the pages (including, e.g., `1/3`, `2/3`, etc.), scan them and convert the scans into **one** PDF to be uploaded (hand-written solutions are OK, as long as they are readable). In case, code has to be submitted, please create **one** ZIP file containing the code (detailed instructions will be available in the exercise sheets).

## Slack channel

The slack channel `#ibcc` is on [`visel.slack.com`](https://visel.slack.com). It should be possible to sign up with your
offical University of Salzburg e-mail address ending in
