# Medical Imaging (PS)

## News

- The Google Meet link for **Q&A** sessions will be available soon!
- The PS will be held **fully online**

## Scheduled Q&A sessions

- **`01/07/2022`** (8:45am - *Vorbesprechung* VO/PS combined)

## Organization

Given the current COVID situation and according to the PLUS guidelines, teaching this course **fully online** seems to be the most reasonable variant.

The PS is based on exercise sheets. The completed exercises of a PS sheet need to be handed-in by the deadline(s) listed below.

You can decide which questions on an exercise sheet to solve. The solutions have to be handed-in by the **deadline** announced below. I will provide, for each student and exercise sheet, an upload link (which will be sent out via e-mail once a new exercise sheet is available).

At the time of the deadline, these links will be deactivated. Note that the links will be **upload** only. For exercises that can be solved on paper, please add your name and student number to each page, number the pages (including, e.g., `1/3`, `2/3`, etc.), scan them and convert the scans into **one** PDF to be uploaded (hand-written solutions are OK, as long as they are readable). In case, code has to be submitted, please create **one** ZIP file containing the code (detailed instructions will be available in the exercise sheets).

## Slack channel

The slack channel `#ibcc` is on [`visel.slack.com`](https://visel.slack.com). It should be possible to sign up with your
offical University of Salzburg e-mail address ending in
`@sbg.ac.at` (`@cosy.sbg.ac.at` and `@stud.sbg.ac.at` work as well).

## Grading

Grading is based on the number of points you collect for the exercise sheets.
