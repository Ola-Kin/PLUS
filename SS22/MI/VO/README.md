# Medical Imaging (VO)

This course covers the topic of **medical imaging**, in particular, different kinds of medical imaging modalities, from data acquisition to processing. In terms of modalities, we will cover X-Ray, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Ultrasound (US).

## News

- The lecture begins on **Tue., March 1, 2022** at **8:45am** (not 8:30am)

## Organization

Given the current COVID + teaching guidelines (see [here](https://www.plus.ac.at/news/lehre-ab-maerz-2022/?pgrp=218&is_paged=0)), the lecture will be held in person. The course is structured as a series of lectures. For each lecture, I will provide *videos* that can be downloaded and watched whenever you prefer. Even though, the lecture is **in person**, students have access to these videos as supplementary material. 

*I do recommend that you watch the lecture videos in the provided order.*

## Slack channel

The slack channel `#medicalimaging` is on [`visel.slack.com`](https://visel.slack.com). It should be possible to sign up with your offical University of Salzburg e-mail address ending in `@plus.ac.at` and `@sbg.ac.at` (`@cosy.sbg.ac.at` and `@stud.sbg.ac.at` work as well).

## Grading

Grading is based on **one final exam** at the end of the course. 

## Lecture material

All the lecture material will be provided in the form of slides, associated lecture videos and written notes. The release of the videos follows the typical course of the lecture. Please check regularly for updates. Once the video is online, the content of the slides is final.
