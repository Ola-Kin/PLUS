# Medical Imaging (VO)

This course covers the topic of **medical imaging**, in particular, different kinds of medical imaging modalities, from data acquisition to processing. In terms of modalities, we will cover X-Ray, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Ultrasound (US).

## News

- The Google Meet link for **Q&A** sessions will be available soon!
- The VO will be held **fully online**

## Scheduled Q&A sessions

- **`03/01/2022`** (8:45am - *Vorbesprechung* VO/PS combined)

## Organization

Given the current COVID situation and according to the PLUS guidelines, teaching this course **fully online** seems to be the most reasonable variant.
The course is structured as a series of lectures. For each lecture, I will provide *videos* that can be downloaded and watched whenever you prefer. 

*I do recommend that you watch the lecture videos in the provided order.*

I will also provide, on a regular basis, an **online Q&A session** (via Google meet, see link above), where you can ask questions, or raise issues that have come up while studying the material. My plan is to do this every (or every other) week. The dates can be found [here](#scheduled-qa-sessions).

## Slack channel

The slack channel `#medicalimaging` is on [`visel.slack.com`](https://visel.slack.com). It should be possible to sign up with your offical University of Salzburg e-mail address ending in `@plus.ac.at` and `@sbg.ac.at` (`@cosy.sbg.ac.at` and `@stud.sbg.ac.at` work as well).

## Grading

Grading is based on **one final exam** at the end of the course. This exam will also be held online and is an open-book type exam. Exam details will be available towards the end of the summer term (and will be announced here and by e-mail).

## Lecture material

All the lecture material will be provided in the form of slides, associated lecture videos and written notes. The release of the videos follows the typical course of the lecture. Please check regularly for updates. Once the video is online, the content of the slides is final.

### Staying up-to-date

Please, **always check the most recent version** (since updates might have occurred) of this repository.
I do recommend that you simply clone my teaching repository (done once) via

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/rkwitt/teaching.git rkwitt-teaching
```

and then regularly do a `git pull`:

```bash
cd ~/rkwitt-teaching
