## Organization

Given the current COVID + teaching guidelines (see [here](https://www.plus.ac.at/news/lehre-ab-maerz-2022/?pgrp=218&is_paged=0)), the lecture will be held in person. The course is structured as a series of lectures. For each lecture, I will provide *videos* that can be downloaded and watched whenever you prefer. Even though, the lecture is **in person**, students have access to these videos as supplementary material.

*I do recommend that you watch the lecture videos in the provided order.*

## Slack channel

The Slack channel #machinelearning is on [`visel.slack.com`](https://visel.slack.com). It should be possible to sign up with your offical University of Salzburg e-mail address ending in `@plus.ac.at` or `@sbg.ac.at` (`@cosy.sbg.ac.at` and `@stud.sbg.ac.at` work as well).

## Grading

Grading is based on **one final exam** at the end of the course.

## Lecture material

The course is rather self-contained and most of the material will be developed *step-by-step* on the blackboard (which was my iPad for a long time now :). To every video, I will also provide a PDF with my written notes.

Additionally, you can find much of the material in my supporting [slides](ml.pdf), and in the book by Shalev-Schwartz and Ben-David (see below), which is my main reference for the course. Another awesome book (although in slightly different notation here and there) is by Mohri, Rostamizadeh & Talwakar (see also below).

### Staying up-to-date

Please, **always check the most recent version** (since updates might have occurred) of this repository.
I do recommend that you simply clone my teaching repository (done once) via

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/rkwitt/teaching.git rkwitt-teaching
```

and then regularly do a `git pull`:

```bash
cd ~/rkwitt-teaching
cd SS22
git pull
```
