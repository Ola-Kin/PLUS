## Organization

Given the current COVID + teaching guidelines (see [here](https://www.plus.ac.at/news/lehre-ab-maerz-2022/?pgrp=218&is_paged=0)), the PS will be held in person. 

The PS is based on exercise sheets. Each question on an exercise sheet has an associated number of points. You can work together in groups of **three**. The group membership has to be fixed by the time the first exercise sheet is released. Please coordinate with your group colleagues and enter the group information into the spreadsheet [here](https://myfiles.sbg.ac.at/index.php/s/3mXePBWzY78Pc86). While the spreadsheet format should be pretty clear, here is an example of one group with three members:

```
group_00 | Max0 | Mustermann0 | 0101010101
group_00 | Max1 | Mustermann1 | 0101010102
group_00 | Max2 | Mustermann2 | 0101010102
```

Each group can decide which questions on an exercise sheet to solve. These solutions have to be handed-in by the **deadline** announced [below](#Exercise-sheets). I will provide, for each group and exercise sheet, an upload link (which will be sent out via e-mail once a new exercise sheet is available) which can be used to upload the solution(s). All members of the same group will have the **same** upload link. At the time of the deadline, these links will be deactivated. The scanned pages should be composed as **one PDF file** within which each page is numbered (e.g., `1/3`, `2/3`, etc.) and the names of all group members who participated are on the first page. A best-practice example can be found [here](Example-Submission.pdf). 

*Note that there is not just one correct solution to most of the exercises.*

## Slack channel

The slack channel #machinelearning is on [`visel.slack.com`](https://visel.slack.com). It should be possible to sign up with your official University of Salzburg e-mail address ending in `@plus.ac.at` or `@sbg.ac.at` (`@cosy.sbg.ac.at` and `@stud.sbg.ac.at` work as well).

## Grading

Grading is based on the number of points you collect for the exercise sheets.
