# Statistical Learning Theory / Machine Learning / Advanced Machine Learning (PS)

## News

- The PS begins (with a *Vorbesprechung*) on **Tuesday, March 5, 2024** at **11:45am (T01)**

## Organization

The PS will be held in person.

The PS is based on *exercise sheets*. Each question on an exercise sheet has an associated number of points. You can work together in groups of **three**. The group membership has to be fixed by the time the first exercise sheet is released. Please coordinate with your colleagues and enter the group information into the (Google) spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PRRZy7s-641of-0GXz5cncmmDaYmhUjWRPlnfARAomI/edit?usp=sharing). Each group can decide which questions on an exercise sheet to solve. These solutions have to be handed-in by the **deadline** announced [below](#Exercise-sheets).

*Note that there is not just one correct solution to most of the exercises.*

## Slack channel

The slack channel #machinelearning is on [`visel.slack.com`](https://visel.slack.com); maybe use the link [here](https://join.slack.com/t/visel/signup). It should be possible to sign up with your official University of Salzburg e-mail address ending in `@plus.ac.at`, or `@stud.plus.ac.at`, or `@sbg.ac.at` (`@cosy.sbg.ac.at` should work as well).
