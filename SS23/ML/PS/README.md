# Machine Learning (PS)

## News

- The PS begins (with a ) on **Tuesday, March 7, 2023** at **11am (T01)**

## Organization

The PS will be held in person.

The PS is based on *exercise sheets*. Each question on an exercise sheet has an associated number of points. You can work together in groups of **three**. The group membership has to be fixed by the time the first exercise sheet is released. Please coordinate with your  colleagues and enter the group information into the spreadsheet [here](https://myfiles.sbg.ac.at/index.php/s/q9siDmSqcrDkwmx).

Each group can decide which questions on an exercise sheet to solve. These solutions have to be handed-in by the **deadline** announced [below](#Exercise-sheets). I will provide, for each group and exercise sheet, an upload link (which will be sent out via e-mail once a new exercise sheet is available) which can be used to upload the solution(s). All members of the same group will have the **same** upload link. At the time of the deadline, these links will be deactivated. The scanned pages should be composed as **one PDF file** within which each page is numbered (e.g., `1/3`, `2/3`, etc.) and the names of all group members who participated are on the first page. A best-practice example can be found [here](Example-Submission.pdf). 

*Note that there is not just one correct solution to most of the exercises.*

## Slack channel

The slack channel #machinelearning is on [`visel.slack.com`](https://visel.slack.com). It should be possible to sign up with your official University of Salzburg e-mail address ending in `@plus.ac.at` or `@sbg.ac.at` (`@cosy.sbg.ac.at` and `@stud.sbg.ac.at` work as well).

## Grading

Grading is based on the number of points you collect for the exercise sheets.  

## Exercise sheets

| | **Points** | **Link** | **Deadline** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Exercise sheet A  | tba.   | tba. | tba. | 
| Exercise sheet B  | tba.   | tba. | tba. | 
| Exercise sheet C  | tba.   | tba. | tba. | 
| Exercise sheet D  | tba.   | tba. | tba. | 
| Exercise sheet E  | tba.   | tba. | tba. | 

Maybe we will have more than those exercise sheets.

Total points possible: **tba.**
